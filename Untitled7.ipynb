       "\"The paper is a literature review that explores the use of blockchain technology in education. It identifies the benefits, barriers, and current applications of blockchain in education through a bibliometric analysis. The study suggests that although blockchain in education is still in its early stages, it has the potential to benefit the educational sector. The paper aims to provide a foundation for education institutions, policymakers, and researchers to explore other areas where blockchain technology can be implemented in education.Blockchain technology eliminates the need for third-party intermediaries and enables direct verification and transactions. It has progressed through four generations, with each generation focusing on different areas such as finance, smart contracts, regulation and governance, and business integration. The key benefits of blockchain technology are security, decentralization, transparency, and immutability. It has been used in various sectors, including finance, government, education, health, tourism, energy, and banking. By 2025, blockchain technologies are expected to control around 10% of the world's GDP. Blockchain technology in education is in its early stages, with the application of blockchain technology in education being primarily seen in a globally trusted, decentralized higher education credit transfer and grading system called EduCTX. The structures that accompany blockchain technology are cybersecurity capabilities.This paper conducts a systematic literature review on the application of blockchain technology in the education sector. The objective is to provide a detailed understanding of the present scenario in terms of benefits, challenges, present blockchain technology application, and future potential areas where blockchain technology can be implemented in the education sector. The review examines the definition of blockchain technology in education, the methodology used in examining the technology, and the results of using this technology in the education sector. The research questions guiding the review are stated to be how blockchain technology has been defined in educational settings, how the technology has been examined, and what the results of using this technology in an education system are. The study follows the steps involved in conducting a systematic literature review and utilizes the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) diagram to depict the stages involved. The conclusions of the study offer policy-makers, higher education institutions, academicians, managers, and researchers the potential benefits of blockchain technology for the benefit of the education sector.The article discusses the systematic literature review conducted on the use of blockchain technology in education. The authors searched the SCOPUS database for studies on the topic and applied inclusion criteria to select relevant articles. The selected articles were then subject to content analysis to examine their objectives, methodology, and findings. The study reveals that blockchain technology is a relatively new subject in the field of education, and while it has been applied in various areas of research, its application is still immature and lacks widespread public knowledge.This article is a systematic review of the existing literature on the application of blockchain technology in education. The study found that there are issues with scalability, security of smart contracts and user adoption in blockchain technology. However, it is believed that blockchain technology can bring significant changes in the connections between schools, colleges, universities and society. The review found that there is a growing interest in blockchain technology in education since 2017, but year-wise citation is limited. The studies on blockchain technology in education are mostly qualitative or based on reviews, and there is a need for quantitative studies. The article suggests that blockchain technology and its application in education is a multidisciplinary area of research.\""

       "\"The research paper focuses on the attitudes of urban and rural college student teachers towards science. The study surveyed 1080 student teachers from Madurai revenue district using a scale to measure their attitude towards science. The results showed that there is no significant difference in attitudes towards science between urban and rural student teachers. The paper highlights the importance of incorporating science education into student curriculums to meet intellectual needs and foster positive attitudes towards science.The study focused on investigating the level of attitude towards science and its dimensions among college student teachers in urban and rural areas. The researcher found that the attitude towards science among all student teachers was moderate and there was no significant difference between urban and rural college student teachers in their attitude towards science. The study highlights the importance of developing a positive attitude towards science among student teachers as it is necessary for them to become successful teachers in the future and prepare young students for a bright future.The study investigated the attitude of B.Ed. student teachers towards science and the dimensions of personal confidence, involvement with the subject, and usefulness of the subject content. The research methodology involved a survey method, and 1080 B.Ed. students from 20 colleges in Madurai revenue district were selected through random sampling. The findings showed that there is a significant difference between urban and rural college student teachers in the dimension of perception of teacher's attitude, but no significant difference in their attitude towards science in total and its dimensions. The study also found that some student teachers have a high level of personal confidence, involvement, and usefulness towards the subject matter. The tools used for this study included Likert scale and Attitude towards Science Scale. Overall, the study concludes that the attitude of student teachers towards science needs more attention to improve their teaching practices.The study shows that a majority of the student teachers have a moderate level of attitude towards science and its dimensions. A very small percentage of respondents have a high level of attitude towards science. The study suggests that this is because these student teachers might have been exposed to minimum levels of science activities during their undergraduate studies. There is also a significant difference in the attitude towards science between urban and rural college student teachers. The study recommends encouraging student teachers to read magazines and journals related to science.In this article, the attitude of student teachers towards science is discussed. The research found that rural college student teachers lack personal confidence, involvement and usefulness towards the subject content of science, whereas urban college student teachers are better in this regard. However, both urban and rural teacher students have a moderate attitude towards science. The authors suggest that institutions should provide a rich environment for improving the science learning skills of students, organize science exhibitions, and encourage co-curricular and extracurricular activities for promoting awareness about science. The utilization of mass media and high-quality teacher educators are also recommended for improving the situation. Overall, the article highlights the need to improve the attitude of student teachers towards science to promote scientific literacy in society.\""

       "'The OECD\\'s report, \"The Future of Education and Skills: Education 2030,\" highlights the challenges of globalization and technological advancements and stresses the importance of preparing students for the jobs of the future. The report calls for the development of competencies such as curiosity, imagination, resilience, and self-regulation. Education is seen as a critical tool in shaping learners\\' lives, equipping them with the necessary competencies to shape their careers and make a valuable contribution to society.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has launched The Future of Education and Skills 2030 project to help countries determine what knowledge, skills, attitudes and values students need to prosper and shape their world, and how instructional systems can effectively develop these qualities. The project involves a range of stakeholders from around the world, including policy makers, academic experts, school networks, teachers, education leaders, students and social partners. The learning framework, which offers a vision and some underpinning principles for the future of education systems, has been co-created for the OECD Education 2030 project. It is focused on orientation, not prescription, and invites others to join in developing future-ready education for all. The framework revolves around a shared vision of helping every learner develop as a whole person, fulfill his or her potential and shape a shared future built on the well-being of individuals, communities and the planet.The world is facing significant and complex problems, including climate change, economic disruption, technological innovation, social inequality, and global conflicts. As a result, education curricula need to evolve to address these challenges and prepare students to find new solutions for a rapidly changing world. Individual and collective well-being should be at the center of these education goals, which go beyond access to material resources and encompass health, social connections, education, security, and life satisfaction. The OECD Education 2030 framework contributes to the UN 2030 Global Goals for Sustainable Development, aiming to ensure the sustainability of people, profit, planet, and peace through partnership.The concept of inclusive growth emphasizes on the role of education in developing the knowledge, skills, attitudes and values necessary for people to contribute and benefit from sustainable future. Future-ready students need to exercise agency in their own education and throughout life, which implies a sense of responsibility to participate in the world and influence people, events, and circumstances for the better. To enable agency, personalized learning environment that supports and motivates each student and building a solid foundation of literacy and numeracy are necessary. Additionally, students should possess a broad set of knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values in action to become change agents and anticipate the consequences of their actions. The OECD Education 2030 stakeholders have co-developed a “learning compass” that shows how young people can navigate their lives and their world.The article discusses the necessary skills and knowledge required for students to be prepared for the future. It emphasizes the importance of disciplinary knowledge, epistemic knowledge, and procedural knowledge as well as a broad range of cognitive and meta-cognitive, social and emotional, and practical and physical skills. The use of this broader range of knowledge and skills will be mediated by attitudes and values. The article also identifies three further categories of competencies, the \"Transformative Competencies\", that together address the growing need for young people to be innovative, responsible, and aware: Creating new value, Reconciling tensions and dilemmas, and Taking responsibility. The article emphasizes the urgency of innovation for achieving stronger, more inclusive, and more sustainable development.'"
